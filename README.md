Full Project Pathway â€“ Walmart Store Sales Forecasting
ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Setup
Objective:
Forecast weekly sales at Walmart stores and build a dashboard to analyze performance, trends, and model accuracy.

Tools Needed:

Python (with Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib/seaborn, scikit-learn, or Prophet for forecasting)

Excel (for visualization and dashboarding)

Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (for writing Python scripts)

Kaggle dataset (download from this link)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Understand the Dataset
Files Included:

train.csv â€“ Historical weekly sales data by store and department

test.csv â€“ The test set (you can forecast on this later)

features.csv â€“ Additional data like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, markdowns

stores.csv â€“ Info on store types and sizes

Goal:
Predict Weekly_Sales for each (Store, Dept) using the additional data.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
Steps:

Merge all files into a single dataset using keys: Store, Date, and Dept.

Convert Date column into datetime format.

Handle missing values: Impute or drop missing values in features like MarkDown, Fuel_Price, etc.

Create time-based features: Week number, month, year, holidays (from IsHoliday), etc.

Normalize or scale numerical variables (optional but helpful for some models).

Explore Data:

Total sales by store, department, and time

Impact of holidays and markdowns

Seasonality or trends over time

ðŸ”¹ 4. Forecasting / Modeling (Python)
Options:

For basic forecasting: Prophet or statsmodels ARIMA

For ML-based: Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, or LightGBM

Ideas:

Forecast total store-level weekly sales (simpler)

Or forecast department-wise per store (more granular)

Use cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE)

Output:

A dataframe with predicted sales values for each week and store.

Comparison between actual vs. predicted sales for training data.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Export Data to Excel (from Python)
Structure your Excel file with multiple sheets:

Forecast Results â€“ Weekly actual vs. predicted

Store Summary â€“ Total sales per store, with growth %

Dept Summary â€“ Department-wise trends

Features Used â€“ Cleaned feature data (fuel, temp, markdown)

Raw Data (optional)

Format Options:

Use openpyxl or xlsxwriter in Python to write styled Excel files

Or simply export .csv files from Python and format manually in Excel

ðŸ”¹ 6. Create Interactive Dashboard in Excel
Elements to include:

âœ… Summary KPIs (top of sheet)

Total forecasted sales

Forecast accuracy (e.g., MAE, MAPE)

Best/Worst performing store/dept

âœ… Charts & Visuals

Line chart: Actual vs. forecast sales over time

Bar chart: Sales by store or department

Heatmap or conditional formatting: Forecast error by week/store

Trend chart: Markdown vs. sales

âœ… Interactive Controls

Slicers: Store, department, date range

Drop-downs: Choose metric (sales, error, markdown)

Pivot tables linked to slicers for drill-down analysis

âœ… Optional Sheet:

"Forecast Playground" â€” let users input upcoming markdowns, toggle holiday flags, and see predicted impact (manually or from Python simulations)

ðŸ”¹ 7. Presentation & Reporting
Wrap your work with:

A one-page project summary (business context, methods used, key findings)

Short write-up of model performance and why the chosen method worked

Dashboard walkthrough and how it helps stakeholders (store managers, planners)

ðŸ”¹ 8. Bonus Enhancements
Add VBA buttons to refresh dashboards or link slicer controls

Use Power Query to auto-load latest CSV exports from Python

Version control: Keep Python scripts, dataset snapshots, and Excel files organized

âœ… Final Outcome:
A forecasting model in Python that accurately predicts future sales

A professional Excel dashboard that allows users to analyze trends, forecast results, and store performance interactively

A reusable and extensible pipeline for future datasets or store chains
